# Things we should remember
- We could make a dataReader class with the shared data format and the reader and have the other readers inherit from that like weatherReader

- Have a unique identifier for each running of the program, like the mac address or something, my limerick reader says temp in ireland is c, my japan reader says temp in ireland is y


- [ ] Build the data collector base class, test by extending it to the system data collector
- [ ] finish the data model
- [ ] do the download queue
